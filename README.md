# CS Playground
## Project to implement:
* Standard CS algorithms and data structures idiomatically in different languages
* Interview questions - Each language directory has a miscellaneous section, which is that language's implementation of different problems
* Libraries exploration
* Tests/frameworks best practices

Disclaimer: This is just my personal exporation playground, I'm not responsible for correctness or best practices.
